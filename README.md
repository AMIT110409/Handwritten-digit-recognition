# Handwritten-digit-recognition
Handwritten digit recognition is a computer vision problem that requires recognising and categorising handwritten digits into numerical values. It is a subfield of pattern recognition and machine learning with applications in postal mail sorting, bank cheque processing, signature verification, and digitising historical documents.
The process of handwritten digit recognition typically involves the following steps:

Data Collection: A dataset of handwritten digit images is collected, which includes images of digits written by different individuals, in different styles, and with varying degrees of variation.

Data Preprocessing: The collected dataset is preprocessed to remove any noise or irrelevant information, and to normalize the images to a consistent size and resolution. This step may also involve data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to increase the diversity of the dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize to different writing styles.

Feature Extraction: Features or patterns are extracted from the preprocessed images to represent the characteristics of the digits. Common feature extraction techniques include pixel intensity values, shape-based features, and texture-based features.

Model Training: A machine learning model is trained using the preprocessed dataset and the extracted features. Various machine learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, decision trees, and deep neural networks can be used for training the model. The model learns to recognize the patterns in the images and associate them with their corresponding numerical values.

Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using a separate validation or test dataset to assess its performance. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Model Fine-tuning: Based on the evaluation results, the model may be fine-tuned by adjusting its hyperparameters or using techniques such as cross-validation or regularization to improve its performance.

Model Deployment: Once the model is trained and fine-tuned, it can be deployed in real-world applications for handwritten digit recognition. This may involve integrating the model into an application or system that can take input in the form of handwritten digit images and produce the corresponding numerical output.

Handwritten digit recognition has made significant progress in recent years with the advancements in machine learning and deep learning techniques. State-of-the-art models using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have achieved high accuracy rates in recognizing handwritten digits, surpassing human performance in some cases.
